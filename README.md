##project

My name is Josh Laughry
My background is in Finance and Accounting, I have worked in financial services and the investment world for the past 10 years. I have an MBA from SMU and looking to transition into the FinTech industry where I can leverage my skills with either a smaller start up or more established comopany.
I chose FinTech because of my interest in finance, capital markets, and technology and the products or disruptors that are being created in the mnarket.
